    <h5>Reading makes you smart, here&#39;s some you should start with</h5>
    

</div>


    <br> <div class="text-justify"><p>I read a lot, usually two or three books at one time and feel that my reading addiction has been a real game changer in my personal development. Below is a list of books I believe everyone should read.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2feUmX2">Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win</a> by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin</p>

<p>If you are entering the work force or in a position of leadership (at any level) you need to read this book. If you are in the military or considering joining the military, you really need to READ THIS BOOK. Adopting principles from this book has helped my military career, since of purpose and personal well-being 10x. <em>There is no such thing as a bad team, only bad leaders</em></p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2jFKPvD">Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning </a> by Viktor E. Frankl</p>

<p>This book is a classic and I have re-read this book over the years many times as it is a short, easy read along with being extremely profound. Viktor Frankl was a jew, forced to work in four Nazi camps during 1942-1945. During this time he faced some of the most unimaginable suffering a human can face, but that is not what this book is about. Instead Frankl outlines that suffering happens to everyone and it is how you cope with it that is important. Finding meaning in it and moving forward is what human&rsquo;s desire. Lastly, Frankl has one of my favorite quotes of all time in this book: <em>From all this we may learn that there are two races of men in this world, but only these two - the &ldquo;race&rdquo; of the decent man and the &ldquo;race&rdquo; of the indecent man. Both are found everywhere; they penetrate into all groups of society</em></p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2f2v2Gn">How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People</a> by Dale Carnegie</p>

<p>Like most books from Dale Carnegie, amazing content, awful title. The “influence people” part can put people off based on the title but don’t let it. This book is a classic and is still relevant today. Additionally, DO NOT get the digital age version, its not really worth it and just sprinkles in the words e-mail and computer throughout. Some of the stories will be dated, but you can easily leverage those ideas to the current day.</p>

<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2eYCOxG">So Good the Can’t Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love</a> by Cal Newport</p>

<p>Anything by Cal Newport is worth a read in my opinion. This guy is a machine cranking out peer- reviewed research papers while putting out quality books and blog posts weekly. I particular like this book because it goes against the idea of “following your passion” and instead suggest you should get really good at an in-demand skill then leverage your ability for favorable work conditions. Instead of chronic job hopping, adopt a craftsmen mentality and get really good at something that pays well. Use your spare time for hobbies.</p>
